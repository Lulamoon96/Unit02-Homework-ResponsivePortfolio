# Unit02-Homework-ResponsivePortfolio
This homework is a continuation of Unit 01, with the portfolio now being responsive.

## Responsiveness

### Bootstrap
The webpage uses elements from Bootstrap to build the site.

### Size Changes
The webpage now reacts differently based on how large the webpage is. For extra small screens, the navbar and brand get stacked.

The portfolio now consists of multiple rows and columns to separate our elements.
